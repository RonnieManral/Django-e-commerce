# Django-e-commerce

I have built this e-commerce website using Python framework (Django) .
This website is completely responsive as i have used the gird and columns of bootstrap and and i have added some html css javascript to it for making additional functionalities.
In this user can see different products according to products category wise. Clicking on different category items users will see only the products related to that category.
I have provided signup,login and logout features to add different users and users can also fill 
his/her personal details and can also edit them.
User can only add products to the cart if the user is authenticated or login to the website otherwise the user is not allowed to add products in the cart.
